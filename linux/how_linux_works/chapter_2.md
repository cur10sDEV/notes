# The Shell

- Every unix system needs a version of **bourne** shell in order to funciton correctly.

- Linux uses an enhanced version of bourne shell called **bash** or **Bourne-again shell**.

> /bin/sh is normally a link to bash on a linux system.

> **chsh** changes your shell.

- Unix processes uses I/O _streams_ to read and write data.

- Processes read data from input streams and write data to output streams.

- Streams are very flexible. For example, the source of an input stream can be a file, a device, a terminal window, or even the output stream from another process.
